        <h2><em>Restaurant Description</em></h2>
        <p>We are local eatery serving up authentic Korean fried chicken in New Jersey since 2003.
          What sets our chicken apart is our addicting sweet garlic-soy sauce glaze. It comes in a spicy and mild
          option so thereâ€™s something for everyone. We always use fresh chicken that has never been frozen and is
          double fried for that extra crispy crunch.</p>
          <p>Aside from our delicious chicken, we also offer specialties like katsu, dumplings, and incredible french fries.
             A local favorite with a lively, cheerful atmosphere, Boom Boom Chicken is the perfect spot to satisfy your fried
             chicken craving with friends and family.</p>
