// we need to stop with the last 2 elements
// testArray.length - 1 will stop us at the element before the last.

    var currentElement = testArray[position];
    var nextElement = testArray[position + 1];

    // Is currentElement greater than nextElement?
    console.log("Testing " + currentElement + " and " + nextElement

    // Is currentElement less than or equal to nextElement?
    console.log("Testing " + currentElement + " and " + nextElement

        // are they strictly equal(===) to each other?

            + "(strictly equal to): " + (currentElement === nextElement));

        // If they are not strictly equal (===), what are their types?
        if (currentElement !== nextElement) {
            // Use the typeof operator to identify the type of an element
